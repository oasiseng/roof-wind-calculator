# roof-wind-calculator
A sleek, intuitive web-based tool to estimate wind pressures and loads on roof components and cladding for low-rise buildings based on ASCE 7-22. This calculator dynamically interpolates GCp from ASCE figures, supporting various roof types (gable, hip, monoslope), slopes, and enclosure classifications for precise zone-specific results.
